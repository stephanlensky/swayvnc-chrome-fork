# swayvnc-chrome

swayvnc-chrome uses [Sway](https://swaywm.org) with [wayvnc](https://github.com/any1/wayvnc) to create a headless, GPU-accelerated wayland desktop with a browser payload (Chrome), to display one or several web pages.

## Usage

The latest image is always available at `ghcr.io/stephanlensky/swayvnc-chrome:latest`.

To run using `docker-compose`, create a new file named `docker-compose.yml` with the following contents:

```yaml
version: "3.7"

services:
  swayvnc-chrome:
    image: ghcr.io/stephanlensky/swayvnc-chrome:latest
    container_name: swayvnc-chrome
    environment:
      - SWAY_RESOLUTION=1920x1080
      - WAYVNC_PORT=5910
      - WAYVNC_ENABLE_AUTH=true
      - WAYVNC_USERNAME=wayvnc
      - WAYVNC_PASSWORD=wayvnc
    volumes:
      - swayvnc-wayvnc-certs:/certs
    privileged: true
    ports:
      - 5910:5910
    devices:
      - "/dev/dri/renderD128:/dev/dri/renderD128"

volumes:
  swayvnc-wayvnc-certs:
```

Then start the container with:

```
docker-compose up
```

### Authentication

By default, the built-in VNC server has authentication enabled and the username/password both set to `wayvnc`. To disable authentication or change the credentials, edit the environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file created above:

```yaml
services:
  swayvnc-chrome:
    ...
    environment:
      - WAYVNC_ENABLE_AUTH=true  # enable/disable auth
      - WAYVNC_USERNAME=wayvnc  # set username here
      - WAYVNC_PASSWORD=wayvnc  # set password here
```

## Connect

Use a vnc client to connect to the server. [RealVNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/) is recommended for windows, or:

```
$ wlvncc <vnc-server>
# or
$ vinagre [vnc-server:5910]
```
